In case you have doubt why I'm not using semicolon is because I got inspiration from these talks: 

- [Semicolons cannot save you!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlr-FGbhKaI)
- [Are Semicolons Necessary in JavaScript?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsfbh17Ax9I)

# Create an SPA which prompts the user for a chart type, data file(json/csv) and plots the chart for him.

- You are free to decide the schema of json for different charts.
- For inspiration on laying out the components in SPA, you can have a look at `example.png`.
- You don't need to create all the filters, just the time and row limit filter is fine. (Checkout `example.png`)
- Types of charts that should be supported:
    - Sankey Chart
    - Parallel coordinates Chart
    - Simple Line Chart

- Bonus points for:
    - JSON schema verification
    - Extensibility of codebase


You are free to use any framework you want, just include a proper README on how to build and test. 
Commit everything on Github and share the repository URL of it.
